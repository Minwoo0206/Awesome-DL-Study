Various Books Regarding Deep Learning

# Purpose
To study various books about deep learning in various places and to track what I learned before, I made this repo. 

I will also try to comment what I learned and felt while studying specific deep learning books.

# Book
## First Book: Deep Learning With Tensorflow
One year ago, I joined Naver AI Boostcamp to learn deep learning. 
The very first framework I used was `torch`. 
And the very first deep learning area I learned was `Natural Language`.
But, the company I joined is a company providing digital art education toolkits and my job is to make some digitalized drawing tests.
So, I tried to improve my skills by participating in kaggle competitions because I needed to learn how to deal with images well.
Here and there, I found out that I need to be accustomed to tensorflow and image processing.
That's why I chose this book.

### Level
According to Kyobo Bookstore, the level of this book is between novice and intermediate.

### Study Period
2024/06/17 ~ 2024/07/17

### Review
Easy to learn, especially for those who want to learn concepts of central deep learning models.
But, it might not be easy to understand the underlying math problems or code structures within.
This book is written in 2021, so it has some dependency issues. 
You have to solve those problems yourself as requirements.txt is not given though the versions of tensorflow and python are specified.
Personally, I am quite satisfied that I am now able to use tensorflow more freely and got some knowledge about image models besides language models I knew before.
