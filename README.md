# Book
## First Book: Deep Learning With Tensorflow
One year ago, I joined Naver AI Boostcamp to learn deep learning. 
The very first framework I used was `torch`. 
And the very first deep learning area I learned was `Natural Language`.
But, the company I joined is a company providing digital art education toolkits and my job is to make some digitalized drawing tests.
So, I tried to improve my skills by participating in kaggle competitions because I needed to learn how to deal with images well.
Here and there, I found out that I need to be accustomed to tensorflow and image processing.
That's why I chose this book.
